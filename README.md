# dotfiles

## overview

I'm  a believer that dotfiles are  personal in that we're all different and so we each have our own likes and dislikes. I've been manually maintaining dotfiles for years and whenever I get a new computer, or refresh an existing one, the process starts over from scratch of installing the packages I need and configuring them to my liking.

When I did this process for El Capitan a few weeks ago I decided to finally automate the process and save myself a few hours in the coming years.

Seeking inspiration for a running start from [Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) I took that as a base and made it my own, removing and adding as works for me. I'm still in the fine tuning phase with the goal of getting it fully idempotent, complete and personal over time.

Use these at your own risk as YMMV :).
